PedigreeSim is licensed under a GPLv2 license, so I am redistributing
it here also under a GPLv2 license. The terms of this license are
available [here](./gpl-2.0.md). Since I only provide a pre-compiled
binary version of PedigreeSim in this repository, the terms of the
GPLv2 license require me to make available the source to any party who
asks. The source is currently available on GitHub by the authors,
<https://github.com/PBR/pedigreeSim>, but to fulfill the terms of the
GPLv2 license, you can always use my repo
<https://github.com/dcgerard/pedigreeSim>.
